## Bluetooth Control and Sensor Data

To control the robot car via Bluetooth and receive sensor data, you can use the following apps:

- Android: [Bluetooth RC Car](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&pcampaignid=web_share)
- Android: [ArduTooth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frederikhauke.ArduTooth&pcampaignid=web_share)

Connect your smartphone to the Bluetooth module on the robot car and use the app to send commands and receive data.
